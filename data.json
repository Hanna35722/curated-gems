By consistently recording and articulating daily experiences, emotions, and thoughts, they developed a stronger connection with their inner self. This practice led to two significant changes: sharper personal boundaries in social interactions (allowing for quicker recognition and response to discomfort) and the elimination of 'verbal aphasia' in writing, as the constant articulation generated a continuous flow of ideas and feelings for content creation.",
